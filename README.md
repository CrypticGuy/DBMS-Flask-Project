# DBMS-Flask-Project

## Instructions to Setup

1. clone the repository on to your pc
2. `cd` into the **DBMS-Flask-Project** folder
3. Open terminal in this folder and type the command to create a virtualenv
4. `python3 -m venv env`, this creates a virtualenv folder with the name *env*. I you go for any other name, remember to add it to the **.gitignore** file. In simple words avoid it.
6. `pip install -r requirements.txt`,  to install any new dependency that someone else added
7. Make any changes that you want to, preferably in your own branch, but the *master* is fine if it complicates stuff.
8. If you have added any other python dependencies, dont forget to do a `pip freeze requirements.txt`, to add the new dependencies to the requirements.txt file.
9. *add, commit and push* are standard.
10. That's it for now, but more instructions will be added soon.
